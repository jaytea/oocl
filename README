The OBJECT ORIENTED COMMUNICATION LIBRARY  (oocl)
is intended to be a platform independent and easy to use c++ library for network communication.

It is currently very much work in progress, so don't be surprised if something does not work.
If you have suggestions you can contact me via github (https://github.com/jaytea).

LICENSE:
The library is released under the zlib-license! So feel free to do whatever you want with it, just give us credit if you use it.

INSTALLATION:
We use cmake for oocl to get it as plattform independend as possible. Just get CMake from their website http://www.cmake.org/ and let it run on oocl. You should not have to do anything manually.
